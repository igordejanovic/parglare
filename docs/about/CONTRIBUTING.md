Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit
helps, and credit will always be given.

You can contribute in many ways:


## Types of Contributions

### Report Bugs

Report bugs at https://github.com/igordejanovic/parglare/issues.

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

- Your operating system name and version.
- Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
- Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.


### Fix Bugs

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug" and "help
wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.


### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement"
and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.


### Write Documentation

parglare could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official
parglare docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and
such.


### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at
https://github.com/igordejanovic/parglare/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

- Explain in detail how it would work.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
- Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are
  welcome :)


## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `parglare` for local development.

1. Fork the `parglare` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally:

        $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/parglare.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtual environment. This is how you set up
   your fork for local development:

        $ cd parglare/
        $ python -m venv venv
        $ source venv/bin/activate
        $ ./install-dev.sh

   This is needed just the first time. To work on parglare later you just need
   to activate the virtual environment for each new terminal session:

        $ cd parglare/
        $ source venv/bin/activate

4. Create a branch for local development::

        $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, run tests:

        $ ./runtests.sh

   and verify that all tests pass.

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

        $ git add .
        $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
        $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Check [this](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) on how to write nice
   git log messages.

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website. CI will run the tests for
   all supported Python versions. Check in the GitHub UI that all pipelines pass.


## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds/changes functionality, the docs should be updated.
3. The pull request should work for Python 3.4-3.8. Check
   https://travis-ci.org/igordejanovic/parglare/pull_requests and make sure that
   the tests pass for all supported Python versions.


## Tips

To run a subset of tests:

```
$ py.test tests/func/mytest.py
```

or a single test:

```
$ py.test tests/func/mytest.py::some_test
```
